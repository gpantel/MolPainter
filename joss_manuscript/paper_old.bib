abstract = {Biological macromolecules function in highly crowded cellular environments. The structure and dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids are well characterized in vitro, but in vivo crowding effects remain unclear. Using molecular dynamics simulations of a comprehensive atomistic model cytoplasm we found that protein-protein interactions may destabilize native protein structures, whereas metabolite interactions may induce more compact states due to electrostatic screening. Protein-protein interactions also resulted in significant variations in reduced macromolecular diffusion under crowded conditions, while metabolites exhibited significant two-dimensional surface diffusion and altered protein-ligand binding that may reduce the effective concentration of metabolites and ligands in vivo. Metabolic enzymes showed weak non-specific association in cellular environments attributed to solvation and entropic effects. These effects are expected to have broad implications for the in vivo functioning of biomolecules. This work is a first step towards physically realistic in silico whole-cell models that connect molecular with cellular biology.},

However, their cost and lifetime remain the two major key issues for a widespread commercialization. Consequently, much attention has been devoted to optimizing the membrane/electrode assembly that constitute the fuel cell core. The electrodes consist of carbon black supporting Pt nanoparticles and Nafion as the ionomer binder. Although the ionomer plays a crucial role as ionic conductor through the electrode, little is known about its distribution inside the electrode. Here we report the three-dimensional morphology of the Nafion thin layer surrounding the carbon particles, which is imaged using electron tomography. The analyses reveal that doubling the amount of Nafion in the electrode leads to a twofold increase in its degree of coverage of the carbon, while the thickness of the layer, around 7{\^{a}} €‰nm, is unchanged.},

In this work, we describe the new features and major improvements in Membrane Builder that allow users to robustly build realistic biological membrane systems, including (1) addition of new lipid types, such as phosphoinositides, cardiolipin (CL), sphingolipids, bacterial lipids, and ergosterol, yielding more than 180 lipid types, (2) enhanced building procedure for lipid packing around protein, (3) reliable algorithm to detect lipid tail penetration to ring structures and protein surface, (4) distance-based algorithm for faster initial ion displacement, (5) CHARMM inputs for P21 image transformation, and (6) NAMD equilibration and production inputs. The robustness of these new features is illustrated by building and simulating a membrane model of the polar and septal regions of E. coli membrane, which contains five lipid types: CL lipids with two types of acyl chains and phosphatidylethanolamine lipids with three types of acyl chains.

abstract = {For simulations of membranes and membrane proteins, the generation of the lipid bilayer is a critical step in the setup of the system. Membranes comprising multiple components pose a particular challenge, because the relative abundances need to be controlled and the equilibration of the system may take several microseconds. Here we present a comprehensive method for building membrane containing systems, characterized by simplicity and versatility. The program uses preset, coarse-grain lipid templates to build the membrane, and also allows on-the-fly generation of simple lipid types by specifying the headgroup, linker, and lipid tails on the command line. The resulting models can be equilibrated, after which a relaxed atomistic model can be obtained by reverse transformation. For multicomponent membranes, this provides an efficient means for generating equilibrated atomistic models. The method is called insane, an acronym for INSert membrANE. The program has been made available, together with the complementary method for reverse transformation, at http://cgmartini.nl/. This work highlights the key features of insane and presents a survey of properties for a large range of lipids as a start of a computational lipidomics project.},

abstract = {Dimers are the smallest chemical objects that show magnetic anisotropy. We focus on 3d and 4d transition metal dimers that have magnetic ground states in most cases. Some of these magnetic dimers have a considerable barrier against re-orientation of their magnetization, the so-called magnetic anisotropy energy, MAE. The height of this barrier is important for technological applications, as it determines, e.g., the stability of information stored in magnetic memory devices. It can be estimated by means of relativistic density functional calculations. Our approach is based on a full-potential local-orbital method (FPLO) in a four-component Dirac-Kohn-Sham implementation. Orbital polarization corrections to the local density approximation are employed. They are discussed in the broader context of orbital dependent density functionals. Ground state properties (spin multiplicity, bond length, harmonic vibrational frequency, spin- and orbital magnetic moment, and MAE) of the 3d and 4d transition metal dimers are evaluated and compared with available experimental and theoretical data. We find exceptionally high values of MAE, close to 0.2 eV, for four particular dimers: Fe(2), Co(2), Ni(2), and Rh(2).},

For this, nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations unravel ordering processes during the gradual assembly of the monolayer. Along this line, different packing motifs of octadecyl phosphonic acid (ODPA) on the (0001) surface of $\alpha$-alumina and implications for the final density and ordering of the resulting monolayers are elucidated. Moreover, the role of the solvent is discriminated by comparing SAM formation in 2-propanol, hexane and in a vacuum.},

To determine the optimal size, structure, and density of PEG for drug delivery, the structure and dynamics of PEGylated drug carriers need to be understood close to the atomic scale, as can be done using molecular dynamics simulations, assuming that these simulations can be validated by successful comparisons to experiments. Starting with the development of all-atom and coarse-grained PEG models in 1990s, PEGylated drug carriers have been widely simulated. In particular, recent advances in computer performance and simulation methodologies have allowed for molecular simulations of large complexes of PEGylated drug carriers interacting with other molecules such as anticancer drugs, plasma proteins, membranes, and receptors, which makes it possible to interpret experimental observations at a nearly atomistic resolution, as well as help in the rational design of drug delivery systems for applications in nanomedicine.

The formation of macroscopic lipid domains by lipid mixtures has been the subject of many simulation investigations. We present a critical study of system size impact on lipid domain phase separation into liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered macroscale domains in ternary lipid mixtures. In the popular di-C16:0 PC:di-C18:2 PC:cholesterol at 35:35:30 ratio mixture, we find systems with a minimum of 1480 lipids to be necessary for the formation of macroscopic phase separated domains and systems of 10 000 lipids to achieve structurally converged conformations similar to the thermodynamic limit. To understand these results and predict the behavior of any mixture forming two phases, we develop and investigate an analytical Flory-Huggins model which is recursively validated using simulation and experimental data. We find that micro-and macroscale domains can coexist in ternary mixtures. Additionally, we analyze the distributions of specific lipid-lipid interactions in each phase, characterizing domain structures proposed based on past experimental studies. These findings offer guidance in selecting appropriate system sizes for the study of phase separations and provide new insights into the nature of domain structure for a popular ternary lipid mixture.

Although consensus is developing over the microscopic structure of the lipid matrix, no molecular-resolution model describes the permeability of all chemical species simultaneously. Using molecular dynamics simulations of a model mixture of skin lipids, the self-assembly of the lipid matrix lamellae has been studied. At higher humidity, the resulting lamellar phase is maintained by partitioning excess water into isolated droplets of controlled size and spatial distribution. The droplets may fuse together to form intralamellar water channels, thereby providing a pathway for the permeation of hydrophilic species.

Basic molecular components are connected using an equivalence operator which reduces and often removes the need for users to explicitly rotate and translate components as they assemble systems. Additionally, the programmatic nature of this approach and integration with the scientific Python ecosystem seamlessly exposes high-level variables that users can tune to alter the chemical composition of their systems, such as mixtures of polymers of different chain lengths and surface patterning. Leveraging these features, we demonstrate how mBuild serves as a stepping stone towards screening and performing optimizations in chemical parameter space of complex materials by performing automated screening studies of monolayer systems as a function of graft type, degree of polymerization, and surface density.},

abstract = {Coarse-grained models have long been considered indispensable tools in the investigation of biomolecular dynamics and assembly. However, the process of simulating such models is arduous because unconventional force fields and particle attributes are often needed, and some systems are not in thermal equilibrium. Although modern molecular dynamics programs are highly adaptable, software designed for preparing all-atom simulations typically makes restrictive assumptions about the nature of the particles and the forces acting on them. Consequently, the use of coarse-grained models has remained challenging. Moltemplate is a file format for storing coarse-grained molecular models and the forces that act on them, as well as a program that converts moltemplate files into input files for LAMMPS, a popular molecular dynamics engine. Moltemplate has broad scope and an emphasis on generality. It accommodates new kinds of forces as they are developed for LAMMPS, making moltemplate a popular tool with thousands of users in computational chemistry, materials science, and structural biology. To demonstrate its wide functionality, we provide examples of using moltemplate to prepare simulations of fluids using many-body forces, coarse-grained organic semiconductors, and the motor-driven supercoiling and condensation of an entire bacterial chromosome.},

abstract = {The analysis of the structural organization of lipid bilayers is generally performed across the direction normal to the bilayer/water interface, whereas the surface properties of the bilayer at the interface with water are often neglected. Here, we present PackMem, a bioinformatic tool that performs a topographic analysis of the bilayer surface from various molecular dynamics simulations. PackMem unifies and rationalizes previous analyses based on a Cartesian grid. The grid allows identification of surface regions defined as lipid-packing defects where lipids are loosely packed, leading to cavities in which aliphatic carbons are exposed to the solvent, either deep inside or close to the membrane surface. Examples are provided to show that the abundance of lipid-packing defects varies according to the temperature and to the bilayer composition. Because lipid-packing defects control the adsorption of peripheral proteins with hydrophobic insertions, PackMem is instrumental for us to understand and quantify the adhesive properties of biological membranes as well as their response to mechanical perturbations such as membrane deformation.},

The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License.

abstract = {An approach for the efficient simulation of phase-separated lipid bilayers, for use in the calculation of equilibrium free energies of partitioning between lipid domains, is proposed. The methodology exploits restraint potentials and rectangular aspect ratios that enforce lipid phase separation, allowing for the simulation of smaller systems that approximately reproduce bulk behavior. The utility of this approach is demonstrated through the calculation of potentials of mean force for the translation of a transmembrane protein between lipid domains. The impact of the imposed restraints on lipid tail ordering and lipid packing are explored, providing insight into how restraints can best be employed to compute accurate free-energy surfaces. This approach should be useful in the accurate calculation of equilibrium partition coefficients for transmembrane protein partitioning in heterogeneous membranes, providing insight into the thermodynamic driving forces that control this fundamental biophysical phenomenon.},

abstract = {Elevated levels of cellular cholesterol have been identified as one factor contributing to the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specific interaction between cholesterol and the amyloid precursor protein (APP), investigated via NMR experiments and computational studies, has been proposed to play a critical role in the processing of APP by secretases and the biogenesis of amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) protein. We present all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the 40-residue congener of the C-terminal domain of APP, C9916-55 (C99), in cholesterol-enriched DMPC lipid bilayers. We investigated the effect of cholesterol concentration on the conformational ensemble of wild-type C99 and C99-cholesterol associations at the low pH of endosomal environments, at which residues E22 and D23 are neutral. C99 was also characterized in liquid ordered domains for Dutch (E22Q) and Iowa (D23N) Familial AD mutants at low pH and for the wild-type sequence using protonation states characteristic of neutral pH. Our results reproduce the equilibrium constant of past NMR characterizations of the C99-cholesterol interaction but are not consistent with the C99-cholesterol binding hypothesis. We find that the lifetimes of both DMPC and cholesterol complexed with C99 display a power-law distribution of residence lifetimes. Longer-lived C99-DMPC and C99-cholesterol complexes are primarily stabilized by salt bridges and hydrogen bonds of lysine amines to phosphate and hydroxyl groups. Nevertheless, specific interfaces for C99-cholesterol association which are not present for DMPC can be identified. Changes to C99-cholesterol interfaces are found to depend on C99 tilt angle and orientation of the juxtamembrane domain of C99 containing residues E22 and D23. These observations support a more nuanced view of the C99-cholesterol interaction than has previously been suggested. We propose that cholesterol modulates the conformation and activity of C99 and other small transmembrane proteins indirectly through induction of the liquid ordered phase and directly through hydrogen bonding. This suggests a critical role for membrane heterogeneity introduced by cholesterol in modulating the structural ensemble of C99 and the production of A$\beta$.},

Experimental and computational advances are converging in a rapidly expanding research area of lipid-protein interactions. Experimentally, the database of high-resolution membrane protein structures is growing, as are capabilities to identify the complex lipid composition of different membranes, to probe the challenging time and length scales of lipid-protein interactions, and to link lipid-protein interactions to protein function in a variety of proteins. Computationally, more accurate membrane models and more powerful computers now enable a detailed look at lipid-protein interactions and increasing overlap with experimental observations for validation and joint interpretation of simulation and experiment. Here we review papers that use computational approaches to study detailed lipid-protein interactions, together with brief experimental and physiological contexts, aiming at comprehensive coverage of simulation papers in the last five years. Overall, a complex picture of lipid-protein interactions emerges, through a range of mechanisms including modulation of the physical properties of the lipid environment, detailed chemical interactions between lipids and proteins, and key functional roles of very specific lipids binding to well-defined binding sites on proteins. Computationally, despite important limitations, molecular dynamics simulations with current computer power and theoretical models are now in an excellent position to answer detailed questions about lipid-protein interactions.},

abstract = {The 99-residue C-terminal domain of amyloid precursor protein (APP-C99), precursor to amyloid beta (A $\beta$ ), is a transmembrane (TM) protein containing intrinsically disordered N- and C-terminal extramembrane domains. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that the structural ensemble of the C99 monomer is best described in terms of thousands of states. The C99 monomer has a propensity to form $\beta$ -strand in the C-terminal extramembrane domain, which explains the slow spin relaxation times observed in paramagnetic probe NMR experiments. Surprisingly, homodimerization of C99 not only narrows the conformational ensemble from thousands to a few states through the formation of metastable $\beta$ -strands in extramembrane domains but also stabilizes extramembrane $\alpha$ -helices. The extramembrane domain structure is observed to dramatically impact the homodimerization motif, resulting in the modification of TM domain conformations. Our study provides an atomic-level structural basis for communication between the extramembrane domains of the C99 protein and TM homodimer formation. This finding could serve as a general model for understanding the influence of disordered extramembrane domains on TM protein structure.},

@article{Huang1999,
abstract = {We recently reported the equilibrium maximum solubility of cholesterol in a lipid bilayer, $\chi$(chol)/* to be 0.66 in four different phosphatidylcholines, and 0.51 in a phosphatidylethanolamine (Huang, J., J. T. Buboltz, and G. W. Feigenson, 1999. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. in press). Here we present a model of cholesterol-phospholipid mixing that explains these observed values of $\chi$(chol)/*. Monte Carlo simulations show that pairwise-additivity of nearest-neighbor interactions is inadequate to describe all the $\chi$(chol)/* values. Instead, if cholesterol multibody interactions are assigned highly unfavorable energy, then jumps occur in cholesterol chemical potential that lead to its precipitation from the bilayer. Cholesterol precipitation is most likely to occur near three discrete values of cholesterol mole fraction, 0.50, 0.57, and 0.67, which correspond to cholesterol/phospholipid mole ratios of 1/1, 4/3, and 2/1, respectively. At these solubility limits, where cholesterol chemical potential jumps, the cholesterol-phospholipid bilayer mixture forms highly regular lipid distributions in order to minimize cholesterol-cholesterol contacts. This treatment shows that dramatic structural and thermodynamic changes can occur at particular cholesterol mole fractions without any stoichiometric complex formation. The physical origin of the unfavorable cholesterol multibody interaction is explained by an 'umbrella model': in a bilayer, nonpolar cholesterol relies on polar phospholipid headgroup coverage to avoid the unfavorable free energy of cholesterol contact with water. Thus, at high cholesterol mole fraction, this unfavorable free energy, not any favorable cholesterol-phospholipid interaction, dominates the mixing behavior. This physical origin also explains the 'cholesterol condensing effect' and the increase in acyl chain order parameter in cholesterol- phospholipid mixtures.},

Although consensus is developing over the microscopic structure of the lipid matrix, no molecular-resolution model describes the permeability of all chemical species simultaneously. Using molecular dynamics simulations of a model mixture of skin lipids, the self-assembly of the lipid matrix lamellae has been studied. At higher humidity, the resulting lamellar phase is maintained by partitioning excess water into isolated droplets of controlled size and spatial distribution. The droplets may fuse together to form intralamellar water channels, thereby providing a pathway for the permeation of hydrophilic species. These results reconcile competing data on the outer skin’s structure and broaden the scope of molecular-based methods to improve the safety of topical products and to advance transdermal drug delivery.}
