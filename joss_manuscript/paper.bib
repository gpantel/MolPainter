abstract = {Biological macromolecules function in highly crowded cellular environments. The structure and dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids are well characterized in vitro, but in vivo crowding effects remain unclear. Using molecular dynamics simulations of a comprehensive atomistic model cytoplasm we found that protein-protein interactions may destabilize native protein structures, whereas metabolite interactions may induce more compact states due to electrostatic screening. Protein-protein interactions also resulted in significant variations in reduced macromolecular diffusion under crowded conditions, while metabolites exhibited significant two-dimensional surface diffusion and altered protein-ligand binding that may reduce the effective concentration of metabolites and ligands in vivo. Metabolic enzymes showed weak non-specific association in cellular environments attributed to solvation and entropic effects. These effects are expected to have broad implications for the in vivo functioning of biomolecules. This work is a first step towards physically realistic in silico whole-cell models that connect molecular with cellular biology.},

A conformational search tool is implemented using a molecular mechanics or a semiempirical potential. Input files can be generated for the computational chemistry software supported by Gabe- dit. Some molecular properties of interest are processed directly from the output of the computational chemistry pro- grams; others are calculated by Gabedit before display. Molecular orbitals, electron density, electrostatic potential, nuclear magnetic resonance shielding density, and any other volumetric data properties can be displayed. It can dis- play electronic circular dichroism, UV–visible, infrared, and Raman-computed spectra after a convolution. Gabedit can generate a Povray file for geometry, surfaces, contours, and color-coded planes. Output can be exported to a selection of popular image and vector graphics file formats; the program can also generate a series of pictures for animation. Quantum mechanical electrostatic potentials can be calculated using the partial charges on atoms, or by solving the Poisson equation using the multigrid method. The atoms in molecule charges can also be calculated. Gabedit is platform independent.

The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License.

abstract = {Dimers are the smallest chemical objects that show magnetic anisotropy. We focus on 3d and 4d transition metal dimers that have magnetic ground states in most cases. Some of these magnetic dimers have a considerable barrier against re-orientation of their magnetization, the so-called magnetic anisotropy energy, MAE. The height of this barrier is important for technological applications, as it determines, e.g., the stability of information stored in magnetic memory devices. It can be estimated by means of relativistic density functional calculations. Our approach is based on a full-potential local-orbital method (FPLO) in a four-component Dirac-Kohn-Sham implementation. Orbital polarization corrections to the local density approximation are employed. They are discussed in the broader context of orbital dependent density functionals. Ground state properties (spin multiplicity, bond length, harmonic vibrational frequency, spin- and orbital magnetic moment, and MAE) of the 3d and 4d transition metal dimers are evaluated and compared with available experimental and theoretical data. We find exceptionally high values of MAE, close to 0.2 eV, for four particular dimers: Fe(2), Co(2), Ni(2), and Rh(2).},

abstract = {For simulations of membranes and membrane proteins, the generation of the lipid bilayer is a critical step in the setup of the system. Membranes comprising multiple components pose a particular challenge, because the relative abundances need to be controlled and the equilibration of the system may take several microseconds. Here we present a comprehensive method for building membrane containing systems, characterized by simplicity and versatility. The program uses preset, coarse-grain lipid templates to build the membrane, and also allows on-the-fly generation of simple lipid types by specifying the headgroup, linker, and lipid tails on the command line. The resulting models can be equilibrated, after which a relaxed atomistic model can be obtained by reverse transformation. For multicomponent membranes, this provides an efficient means for generating equilibrated atomistic models. The method is called insane, an acronym for INSert membrANE. The program has been made available, together with the complementary method for reverse transformation, at http://cgmartini.nl/. This work highlights the key features of insane and presents a survey of properties for a large range of lipids as a start of a computational lipidomics project.},

These model membrane systems have proven very useful to study the heterogeneity in cellular membranes, however, con-cerns have been raised about how reliably they can represent native membranes. In this review, we will discuss how phase‐separated membrane systems can mimic cellular membranes and where they fail to reflect the native cell membrane heterogeneity.

abstract = {We recently reported the equilibrium maximum solubility of cholesterol in a lipid bilayer, $\chi$(chol)/* to be 0.66 in four different phosphatidylcholines, and 0.51 in a phosphatidylethanolamine (Huang, J., J. T. Buboltz, and G. W. Feigenson, 1999. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. in press). Here we present a model of cholesterol-phospholipid mixing that explains these observed values of $\chi$(chol)/*. Monte Carlo simulations show that pairwise-additivity of nearest-neighbor interactions is inadequate to describe all the $\chi$(chol)/* values. Instead, if cholesterol multibody interactions are assigned highly unfavorable energy, then jumps occur in cholesterol chemical potential that lead to its precipitation from the bilayer. Cholesterol precipitation is most likely to occur near three discrete values of cholesterol mole fraction, 0.50, 0.57, and 0.67, which correspond to cholesterol/phospholipid mole ratios of 1/1, 4/3, and 2/1, respectively. At these solubility limits, where cholesterol chemical potential jumps, the cholesterol-phospholipid bilayer mixture forms highly regular lipid distributions in order to minimize cholesterol-cholesterol contacts. This treatment shows that dramatic structural and thermodynamic changes can occur at particular cholesterol mole fractions without any stoichiometric complex formation. The physical origin of the unfavorable cholesterol multibody interaction is explained by an 'umbrella model': in a bilayer, nonpolar cholesterol relies on polar phospholipid headgroup coverage to avoid the unfavorable free energy of cholesterol contact with water. Thus, at high cholesterol mole fraction, this unfavorable free energy, not any favorable cholesterol-phospholipid interaction, dominates the mixing behavior. This physical origin also explains the 'cholesterol condensing effect' and the increase in acyl chain order parameter in cholesterol- phospholipid mixtures.},

By using deuterium NMR spectroscopy on multilamellar lipid-sterol systems in combination with Monte Carlo simulations of microscopic models of lipid-sterol interactions, we demonstrate that the evolution in the molecular chemistry from lanosterol to cholesterol is manifested in the model lipid-sterol membranes by an increase in the ability of the sterols to promote and stabilize a particular membrane phase, the liquid-ordered phase, and to induce collective order in the acyl-chain conformations of lipid molecules.

The formation of macroscopic lipid domains by lipid mixtures has been the subject of many simulation investigations. We present a critical study of system size impact on lipid domain phase separation into liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered macroscale domains in ternary lipid mixtures. In the popular di-C16:0 PC:di-C18:2 PC:cholesterol at 35:35:30 ratio mixture, we find systems with a minimum of 1480 lipids to be necessary for the formation of macroscopic phase separated domains and systems of 10 000 lipids to achieve structurally converged conformations similar to the thermodynamic limit. To understand these results and predict the behavior of any mixture forming two phases, we develop and investigate an analytical Flory-Huggins model which is recursively validated using simulation and experimental data. We find that micro-and macroscale domains can coexist in ternary mixtures. Additionally, we analyze the distributions of specific lipid-lipid interactions in each phase, characterizing domain structures proposed based on past experimental studies. These findings offer guidance in selecting appropriate system sizes for the study of phase separations and provide new insights into the nature of domain structure for a popular ternary lipid mixture.

The impact of the imposed restraints on lipid tail ordering and lipid packing are explored, providing insight into how restraints can best be employed to compute accurate free-energy surfaces.

Although consensus is developing over the microscopic structure of the lipid matrix, no molecular-resolution model describes the permeability of all chemical species simultaneously. Using molecular dynamics simulations of a model mixture of skin lipids, the self-assembly of the lipid matrix lamellae has been studied. At higher humidity, the resulting lamellar phase is maintained by partitioning excess water into isolated droplets of controlled size and spatial distribution. The droplets may fuse together to form intralamellar water channels, thereby providing a pathway for the permeation of hydrophilic species. These results reconcile competing data on the outer skin’s structure and broaden the scope of molecular-based methods to improve the safety of topical products and to advance transdermal drug delivery.}
